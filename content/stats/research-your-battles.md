In this post, I'm going to detail an experiential formula for picking a SMART
research project. If your hand is now reaching to close this window I would
implore you to linger a while. I acknowledge that embarking on research
projects is a bane endeavour for a lot of people. That fact is in itself
a motivation for writing this post. I believe that the way we've been taught
(if we've been taught at all) of going about selecting a research project is
wrong. That may be a bold statement
