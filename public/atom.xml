		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&#x27;m going to detail an experiential formula for picking a SMART research project. If your hand is now reaching to close this window I would implore you to linger a while. I acknowledge that embarking on research projects is a bane endeavour for a lot of people. That fact is in itself a motivation for writing this post. I believe that the way we&#x27;ve been taught (if we&#x27;ve been taught at all) of going about selecting a research project is wrong. That may be a bold statement&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You have to be smart. This is the maxim on the tongue of many senior residents
as they instruct our junior residents that working around obstacles and being
determined is the best way to be a star resident. As it so happens. This may not
always be the case. Usually they end up adding extra work. There is a workflow
or worklist and they just add more steps than that workflow thinking that
they&#x27;re working smart to overcome obstacles, like a printer that doesn&#x27;t work in
one ward and I have to go and service itself in another ward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents will exert themselves to develop workarounds for roadblocks to
completing tasks necessary for everyday patient care. This is partly driven by
the fact that attending consultants won&#x27;t accept technical issues as a valid
cause of failure to complete tasks essential to patient care which is valid on
their part as well. However everyday tasks can become increasingly laborious as
the number of workarounds continue to various roadblocks continue to increase
in number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s consider the example of vital monitoring. There continue to exist a number
of hospitals where vitals are recorded by hand on paper flowsheets. A doctor
must physically see the flowsheets or call the ward nurse on the local telephone
extension to inquire about the vitals. Doing either of these can be very taxing
especially if the doctors&#x27; and nurses&#x27; existing workload is considered as well
as the number of times in a day that patients&#x27; vital signs need to be monitored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed wondrous to me that our electronic monitors cannot be configured to
forward vital signs to an app in real-time. It turns out that hospitals cannot
afford to setup this configuration as vendors of vital sign monitors charge
fairly hefty sums in licensing fees to allow hospitals to access devices&#x27; data.
Moreover, different vendors of medical devices have programmed their devices to
generate data in their proprietary format making it excessively tedious to
enable communication between medical devices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of many examples and I&#x27;m sure that the readers can think of more.
Maybe my readers share the following question with me: how did our healthcare
system get so disjointed?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the cause is us: doctors and nurses. We have to increasingly rely
on axillary staff to manage aspects of healthcare that are indirectly
concerned with the science of medicine. This body of axillary staff has grown
overtime to collectively become a force of its own influencing the way we work.
We doctors and nurses have let these axillary staff bodies grow rather than
investing ourselves in the understanding that systems that drive our healthcare
system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction to the notion of active involvement in development and operation of
healthcare system is one of active refusal in medical and nursing personnel as
far as I have observed. This reaction is not unjustified considering that the
required skill set is alien compared to traditional medical and nursing
education. There is no established process of management or oversight of
projects regarding the healthcare system especially when it comes to electronic
devices and electronic medical records. The consequences of failure can be dire
and the potential rewards are difficult to visualize.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I do not think we, doctors and nurses, have the luxury to ignore our
healthcare systems. Our patients need increasingly complex care as the volume of
evidence increases in all medical and nursing disciplines. I think the first
step in doing so is to think about barriers to adopting technological solutions
in our healthcare workplace. Why is it that Amazon and Google are able to
orchestrate their operations using technological solutions but hospitals cannot?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
