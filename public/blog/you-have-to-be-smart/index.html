<p>'You have to be smart.'</p>
<p>â€” Anonymous Resident</p>

<p>This is the maxim on the tongue of many senior residents as they instruct our
junior residents that working around obstacles and being determined is the
best way to be a star resident. This post is about all those times when I
thought this wasn't the case and what we should do about it</p>
<p>Residents will exert themselves to develop workarounds for roadblocks to
completing tasks necessary for everyday patient care. This is partly driven
by the fact that attending consultants won't accept technical issues as a
valid reason for failure to complete tasks essential to patient care. I don't
think there is any blame on them for expecting such. However everyday tasks
can become increasingly laborious as the number of workarounds to various
roadblocks continue to increase in number.</p>

<p>Let's consider the example of vital monitoring. There continue to exist a number
of hospitals where vitals are recorded by hand on paper flowsheets. A doctor
must physically see the flowsheets or call the ward nurse on the local telephone
extension to inquire about the vitals. Doing either of these can be very taxing
especially if the doctors' and nurses' existing workload is considered as well
as the number of times in a day that patients' vital signs need to be monitored.</p>
<p>It seemed wondrous to me that our electronic monitors cannot be configured to
forward vital signs to an app in real-time. It turns out that hospitals cannot
afford to setup this configuration as vendors of vital sign monitors charge
fairly hefty sums in licensing fees to allow hospitals to access devices' data.
Moreover, different vendors of medical devices have programmed their devices to
generate data in their proprietary format making it excessively tedious to
enable communication between medical devices.</p>
<p>This is one of many examples and I'm sure that the readers can think of more.
Maybe my readers share the following question with me: how did our healthcare
system get so disjointed?</p>
<p>I think that the cause is us: doctors and nurses. We have to increasingly rely
on axillary staff to manage aspects of healthcare that are indirectly
concerned with the science of medicine. This body of axillary staff has grown
overtime to collectively become a force of its own influencing the way we work.
We doctors and nurses have let these axillary staff bodies grow rather than
investing ourselves in the understanding that systems that drive our healthcare
system.</p>
<p>The reaction to the notion of active involvement in development and operation of
healthcare system is one of active refusal in medical and nursing personnel as
far as I have observed. This reaction is not unjustified considering that the
required skill set is alien compared to traditional medical and nursing
education. There is no established process of management or oversight of
projects regarding the healthcare system especially when it comes to electronic
devices and electronic medical records. The consequences of failure can be dire
and the potential rewards are difficult to visualize.</p>
<p>Yet I do not think we, doctors and nurses, have the luxury to ignore our
healthcare systems. Our patients need increasingly complex care as the volume of
evidence increases in all medical and nursing disciplines. I think the first
step in doing so is to think about barriers to adopting technological solutions
in our healthcare workplace. Why is it that Amazon and Google are able to
orchestrate their operations using technological solutions but hospitals cannot?</p>
